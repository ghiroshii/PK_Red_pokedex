# Simple random Dex [RED/BLUE]

Get ready for a wild ride through the Kanto region with this interactive Pokémon Red/Blue Random Dex! This Python program, written using the tkinter library, dynamically generates a random Pokémon entry from the original Pokémon Red game's Pokédex data.

## Features

- Randomization: Encounter a different Pokémon each time you click the "RANDOM" button, keeping your Pokedex exploration fresh and exciting.
- Customizable Font: The program utilizes a custom font to evoke a nostalgic Game Boy aesthetic. You can replace this file with your preferred font for a personal touch.
- Visual Appeal: Each displayed Pokémon comes with a corresponding image, resized to fit the Pokédex display.
- Detailed Information: View the randomly chosen Pokémon's name, type(s), and ID number, just like in the classic game.
- Planned Enhancements: While not currently implemented, the code includes placeholders for potential future features like navigation buttons (left and right arrows) for exploring the entire Pokédex sequentially.
